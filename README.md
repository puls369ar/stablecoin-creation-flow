# Stablecoin Creation Flow
Let's learn how to create our custom stablecoin.

# Some Theory
There are four types of stablecoins based on its collateralization
*  Fiat backed
*  Crypto backed
*  Commodity backed
*  Algorithmic

The logic behind the first three methods is simple: Each existing stablecoin should have a peg appropriate to its worth stored in a vault managed by the stablecoin provider.
So, the coin's owner should be able to exchange it with the pegged asset whenever he wants without any problems. In the case of **Algorithmic** one, it keeps stablecoin's value stable around the peg
by minting and burning coin supplies. The latest option is less desirable as it demands complex mechanisms and is not as safe as asset-backed ones. There can also be partially collateralized stablecoins or
hybrid stablecoins that are backed partly by fiat and partly by other coins for example.
